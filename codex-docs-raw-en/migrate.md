# Migrate to Codex | OpenAI Developers

URL: https://developers.openai.com/codex/migrate

---

Use the import flow to bring your instructions, configuration, skills, MCP
servers, hooks, subagents, and recent sessions from another agent into Codex.
Codex migrates the parts it can handle directly and can open a follow-up thread
to help migrate anything that remains.
       

         


## Start the migration


 

- Open Settings in the Codex app.

- On the General page, find Import other agent setup.

- Select Import or Import again.

- Review what Codex found, choose what to bring over, then select Import.

- After the import finishes, select View imported files if you want to inspect the result.
 


## How migration works


Codex checks both your user-level setup and the current project. User-level
setup comes from files on your machine; project-level setup comes from files in
the repository you have open.


When you import, Codex:


- Detects the setup it can find.

- Imports the selected items it can migrate directly.

- Checks again after the import finishes.

- Offers to continue the migration in a new thread if anything still needs
follow-up work.

## Finish remaining setup in a new thread


Some detected setup does not have a clean one-to-one mapping into Codex. For
those items, Codex can open a new thread with the
[`migrate-to-codex`](https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated/migrate-to-codex)
skill to help finish the migration.


When that happens, Codex shows the remaining setup and offers Continue in
Codex.
       

         


If you continue, Codex opens a new thread with the remaining work already filled
in. The thread keeps user-level setup separate from project-level setup so you
can see where each remaining item belongs.
       

         


## What to review after import


Review any migrated setup before you rely on it, especially:


- Tool restrictions or permissions in imported skills and agents.

- MCP server settings that use custom authentication, headers, environment
variables, or transports.

- Hooks whose behavior may differ in Codex.

- Plugins, marketplaces, or other remaining setup that needs manual follow-up.

- Prompt templates or command-style prompts that depend on arguments, shell
interpolation, or file-path placeholders.


## After you switch


Once the import finishes, open one of your migrated projects and continue from
there. If you are new to Codex, see the [quickstart](/codex/quickstart) for the
rest of the setup flow.
